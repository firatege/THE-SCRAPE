Old stars,"The Old Stars form the core group of institutions that would be recognised around the world for their excellence. With an average age of 400 years old, they benefit from centuries of reputation and extensive networks, of academics and alumni. Whilst their position might be thought to be unassailable, the absence of the top University (CalTech) from this group suggests that new ways of working may gain favour.",21,"Singapore, United Kingdom, United States, China, Switzerland, Canada",13,University of Oxford,193,"Exceptional in most areas, strong in all",Slightly less likely to be leading in Education and Psychology
International powerhouse,"Dominated by the US but with significant UK and German participation, this is the group with the greatest chance of catching and surpassing the Old Stars. Their subject mix shows slightly more expertise in Clinical than their peers in the Old Stars group, and slightly less ability in Arts.",85,"Sweden, France, Denmark, Austria, Germany, Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, China, Japan, Switzerland, Finland, Singapore, Australia, Italy, United Arab Emirates, Norway, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon",70,California Institute of Technology,148,Strong in all areas,Slightly less likely to be leading in Education
Life science challengers,"Sitting just behind the Old Stars and International Powerhouse, the Life Science Challengers group is most similar to Technology Challengers, but with a focus leaning towards Life Sciences and Clinical which is reflected in their high Research and Citations scores. This group is more American in nature, with a lower Asian percentage, and is made of established institutions with very few under 50 years old.",123,"Spain, Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, United States, New Zealand, Macao, Switzerland, Italy, Estonia, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Russian Federation, Sweden, China, Portugal, Finland, Australia, France, Israel, Chile, Austria, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia",201-250,Karolinska Institute,136,Strong in most areas,Slightly less strong in Computer Science and Engineering
Technology challengers,"Sitting just behind the Old Stars and International Powerhouse, the Technology Challengers group is most similar to Life Science Challengers, but with a focus leaning towards Physical Sciences and Engineering and Technology. This is also reflected in their higher Industry Income, although they do less well in Research and Citations. This group has a greater Asian and European percentage, and a high percentage of under 50s.",156,"China, Italy, Ireland, Australia, Canada, Germany, United States, United Arab Emirates, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Netherlands, Turkey, Austria, United Kingdom, Norway, Lebanon, Belgium, Greece, South Korea, France, Malaysia, India, Israel, Iran, Russian Federation, Vietnam, Luxembourg, Taiwan",301-350,University of Science and Technology of China,76,"Physical Sciences, Computer Science, Engineering","Law, Clinical, Arts and Humanities"
Effective publishers,"The Effective Publishers are a group of Universities who have been able to score highly in Citations, despite not being as strong in Research and Teaching. Partly this is due to their age – with those under 50 years old making up 37% of their number, they have yet to build the reputation of the older institutions.",148,"India, United Kingdom, China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Romania, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Iraq, Australia, Pakistan, Switzerland, Jordan, Czechia, Egypt, Hungary, Finland, Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam, New Zealand, United Arab Emirates, United States, Brunei Darussalam, Cyprus, Iran, Northern Cyprus, Qatar, Oman, Uzbekistan, Estonia, France, South Korea, Norway, Hong Kong, Italy",601-800,Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech),33,Broadly equally strong in most areas,-
Core strengths,"The Core Strengths group represents the solid heart of the research community. Many of them have yet to build up the success in publishing shown by the Effective Publishers, and with the large percentage of Universities less than 50 years old (34%) this is hardly surprising.",282,"India, Thailand, Australia, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Canada, Japan, Turkey, United States, Bangladesh, China, France, Russian Federation, Germany, Czechia, Italy, Israel, Nigeria, Iceland, Sweden, Ukraine, Spain, Fiji, Cyprus, Ireland, Jordan, Norway, Austria, Morocco, Iraq, Macao, South Africa, Ecuador, Denmark, Northern Cyprus, Greece, Switzerland, New Zealand, South Korea, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Brazil, Vietnam",801-1000,Universität Ulm,36,"Physical Sciences, Social Sciences","Law, Arts and Humanities, Education"
Regional stars,"The most established institutions in Asia and Russia appear in this group: in many ways this is equivalent of the Old Stars group. The strongest regional reputations are to be found here. However, unlike the Old Stars, this group is less outward looking – with a much lower International score.",48,"Portugal, France, United States, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Germany, Spain, Indonesia, Italy, Taiwan, Turkey, Lebanon, Russian Federation, Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Israel, Czechia, Thailand",351-400,Kyoto University,116,"Strong in most areas, especially Engineering, Life Sciences, and Clinical",Law
Developing expertise,"A distinct group of new institutions, both to the World University Rankings and on basis of age – with the lowest average age of any group. These institutions are still developing their research focus.",467,"China, Greece, Iraq, Italy, Iran, United States, South Korea, Japan, Switzerland, India, Turkey, Spain, Tunisia, Peru, Taiwan, Romania, Philippines, France, Thailand, Portugal, Morocco, Ecuador, United Kingdom, Chile, Nepal, Czechia, Poland, Mozambique, Egypt, Slovakia, Algeria, Germany, Ethiopia, Iceland, Lithuania, Brazil, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Jordan, Argentina, Nigeria, Pakistan, Kuwait, South Africa, Estonia, Syria, Malta, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, Ireland, Latvia, Indonesia, Belgium, Lebanon, Bangladesh, Canada, Ghana, Serbia, Austria, Russian Federation, Finland, Cyprus, Botswana, Rwanda, Slovenia, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, Australia, Mauritius, Vietnam, Puerto Rico, Hungary, Palestine, Armenia, Mexico, Bahrain",1201-1500,Vita-Salute San Raffaele University,47,"Physical Sciences, Engineering",Lower in all other areas
Asian challengers,"These institutions are almost all Asian, in Japan, India and China (with a few in Russia). They are established institutions that have very strong links with industry, and perform above expectations in teaching, research and citations. However, they tend not to be as strong in international links as other groups.",226,"Croatia, Italy, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, United States, Germany, Peru, Israel, Taiwan, Serbia, Kazakhstan, Morocco, India, Hungary, Thailand, Turkey, Spain, France, South Africa, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Ghana, Japan, Nigeria, Poland, South Korea, Slovenia, Vietnam, Philippines, Cuba, Canada, New Zealand, Indonesia, Tunisia, Slovakia, Norway, Australia, Chile, Kenya, Portugal, Greece, Belarus, Austria, Czechia, Switzerland, Argentina, Mexico, Ukraine, Lithuania, Uganda, Lebanon, Romania, Ireland",801-1000,Medical University of Vienna,98,"Physical Sciences, Engineering, Computer Sciences","Law, Psychology"
Emerging talents,"These institutions are often based in the BRICS countries or other emerging nations. There are also significant populations from Japan and Korea. They haven’t yet built up their base of citations, but are performing better in all other areas. They tend to have a better relationship with industry than other, more established clusters. Many of these institutions are new to the rankings in 2015-16, and 20% of them are under 50 years old.",535,"Poland, France, Brazil, Japan, Ecuador, Colombia, Ukraine, Chile, Argentina, India, Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan, Romania, Algeria, Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Turkey, Iran, Czechia, Mexico, Hungary, Peru, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, South Korea, Latvia, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Bulgaria, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Spain, Slovenia, Jamaica, Croatia, Tunisia, Vietnam, China, Kenya, Malaysia, Paraguay, South Africa, Georgia, Mongolia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, United States, North Macedonia, Zambia, Morocco, Portugal, Slovakia, Montenegro, Canada, Namibia, Israel",1501+,Tokyo Medical and Dental University,70,"Engineering, Physical Sciences, Life Sciences","Psychology, Arts and Humanities"
